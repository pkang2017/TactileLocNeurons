1. When I do inference, I find the spike matrix contains floating numbers. 
2. When I use dataloader to read testing data, the first batch is not same as the test.txt file, but became the second batch in test.txt

1. In calculate_error_classification()
	err = spikes.detatch() # causes the error calculation chagne the value of spike
2. In DataLoader()
	num_workers = 1 # is causing first minibatch samples to be dropped during inference (test case)
	The issue seems to be solved when using the default parameter of num_workers
